    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>2 eggs, well beaten</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed Cheddar cheese soup (such as Campbell's)</li>
        <li>1 pinch paprika, or as desired (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in macaroni and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and transfer pasta to a slow cooker.</li>
        <li>Add butter to pasta and stir until melted; season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle about 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese over pasta and stir.</li>
        <li>Whisk evaporated milk and eggs together in a bowl until smooth; stir into pasta mixture.</li>
        <li>Whisk milk and condensed soup together in a bowl until smooth; stir into pasta mixture.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle remaining cheese over pasta mixture; garnish with paprika.</li>
        <li>Cook on Low for 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>Some slow cookers take less time. Check the edges are not getting too brown after 2 1/2 hours.</p>

    <p>To bake in a conventional oven, pour pasta mixture into a casserole dish and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes to 1 hour.</p>
